# Using content blocks in the CMS

The [Elemental module](https://addons.silverstripe.org/add-ons/dnadesign/silverstripe-elemental) provides the ability
for SilverStripe users to break up their page content into pieces. This allows for more targeted control over
individual types of content, as well as individual versioning, more detailed reports and easy customisation for
developers over how certain pieces of content are presented.

## Before we begin

Make sure that your SilverStripe CMS installation has the [Elemental module](https://addons.silverstripe.org/add-ons/dnadesign/silverstripe-elemental)
installed, and optionally the [SilverStripe Blocks addon module](https://addons.silverstripe.org/add-ons/silverstripe/elemental-blocks).

We also assume that you have had a developer enable the functionality with configuration before you start.

## Features

* [Create and editing content blocks](edit_content.md)
* [Reordering content blocks](reordering_content.md)
* [Use history and rollback to certain versions](history.md)
